# Project discription

The game is designed to create a peaceful and immersive café environment where players can relax and engage in stress-free gameplay. Players assume the role of a café owner and perform a variety of calming tasks through mini-games, such as unboxing supplies, arranging furniture, decorating the space, and sweeping the floors or even making food/cofee.
The focus is on providing a therapeutic experience without the usual pressure of quick progression. Instead, players advance at their own pace, gradually unlocking new areas of the café, such as a garden patio or rooftop lounge. Each new area offers fresh tasks and opportunities for creativity, enhancing the player’s sense of accomplishment and relaxation.
This project combines engaging mechanics with tranquil visuals and sound design, aiming to reduce anxiety while showcasing thoughtful gameplay complexity.
